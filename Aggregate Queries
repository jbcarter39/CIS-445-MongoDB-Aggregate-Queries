Q1: Select the top 10 most occurring birthdays in our company ordered from greatest to least. 
Show the birthday and the number of employees that share that birthday.

db.employees.aggregate([
  { $group:
      {"_id":
        "$birth_date", 
        "count":{$sum:1} 
        }
  },
  
  { $sort: {"count":-1} },
  
  { $limit: 10  }
]);

Q2: Select the first 10 employees (ordered by employee number) 
and show employee number, first name, last name, and current salary from our company.

db.employees.aggregate([
  {$match: {}}, 
  
  { $project: {
    _id: 0,
    emp_no: 1,
    first_name: 1,
    last_name: 1,
    salaries: 1
    }
  },
  
  { $limit: 10}
]).pretty();

Q3: What is the average salary for all employees (also show the number of active employees used for the average)?

db.employees.aggregate([ 
    { "$project": {
        _id: 0,
        "salary": { 
            "$map": { 
                "input": "$salaries", 
                "as": "s",
                "in": "$$s.salary" 
            } 
        }
        
    }}, 
    { "$unwind": "$salary" }, 
    { "$group": { 
        "_id":  "$_id", 
        "avgSalary": { "$avg": "$salary" },
        count: {$sum: 1}
    }} 
]);

Q4: Select the first 10 employees and show employee number, first name, and last name whose current salary 
is greater than the average salary of all employees. Order it by salaries and then employee number.  
DO NOT copy paste 72012.2359... thats too easy.
